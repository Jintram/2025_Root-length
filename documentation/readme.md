### Workflow and directories with scripts

After having done an analysis, you might have a directory structure as follows. 
("Might have" since you can customize this.)

The original input folder, which might hold multiple subfolders with images:

- `<directory_with_raw_data>`
    - `<some_folder>`
        - `your_file.tif`
        - `(..)`
    - `(..)`

The output folder, which will be structured like this:

- `<data_output_folder>`
    - `LEN/`
        - `LEN/all_samples_length.xlsx` is a summary file which holds the plant root
        lengths for all analyzed plates from the input folder. You can use this for 
        plotting. Metadata about conditions can be added based on file and subfolder
        names.
        - `LEN/data` mirrors the original directory structure, where instead
        of pictures of plates, *there are `.tsv` files, which list the plant lengths
        in the plate. (Plants are assigned unique IDs.)*
        - `LEN/lenplots` mirrors the original directory structure, where instead
        of pictures of plates, *there are plots showing the plates with projected on top
        the lengths of each plant.*    
    - `SEG/`
        - `SEG/plots`  mirrors the original directory structure, where instead
        of pictures of plates, *there are plots showing the segmentation of the plants
        on top of the original image.*
        - `SEG/segfiles` mirrors the original directory structure, where instead
        of pictures of plates, *there are `.npz` datafiles, which each hold information 
        about the segmentation.

The files in the `SEG/` folder are generated by another set of scripts 
("Cheeky-cells"), which are stored in [another repository](https://github.com/Jintram/Cheeky-cells). The files in the `LEN/` folder are generated by the scripts
in this repository, based on the files in the `SEG/segfiles` folder. 

To generate this direcotry structure, in the script, set `DIR_INPUTFILES` to 
`<data_output_folder>/SEG/segfiles` and `DIR_OUTPUTFILES` to 
`<data_output_folder>/LEN/`.
