## Project description

Color images of plants were taken using a scanner (a basic consumer model), with the aim of determining root lenghts
from these color pictures.

At this analysis stage, a set of scripts have already segmented images of roots. The image below shows an overlay both of segmentation and original picture of the plants.

the segmentation).*
